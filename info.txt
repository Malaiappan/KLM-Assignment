Kiosk Redesign Team

Your task is to prepare a Single Page Application using Angular 5.x framework.
- The project should compile and start by issuing npm start
- The application should consist of two screens
- The first screen is so called "Destination Refinement" which allows the user to select where he is flying (design attached).
As part of the task you will need to download reference data from the attached Node.js application (route: /airports) and create an autocomplete that is showing only the three most relevant choices.
- The second screen is only to display the summary of the choice (navigation should happen when Continue button is clicked on the first screen)

Please not that we will focus our attention on HOW this functionality is implemented (code structure, unit tests, etc.) and not even the completeness of the solution.

Please also note that you DO NOT need to follow the example screen-shot (i.e. styling can be simpler etc.). It is provided only to better illustrate the task.
